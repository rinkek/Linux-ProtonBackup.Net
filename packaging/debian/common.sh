# Helpers shared by postinst, prerm and postrm. The build script pastes this file into each of them
# at their marker line, because a maintainer script must stand on its own: by the time postrm runs,
# the package's files are already gone.
#
# Rules for everything in here:
#  - plain POSIX sh (dash, busybox ash), no bashisms;
#  - best effort. A package that cannot be removed because a helper failed is far worse than a
#    timer that was left running, so no function may make the calling script fail;
#  - never touch anything below /home. Per-user state is the app's business (`protonbackup --cleanup`).

protonbackup: the settings, the database and the downloaded Proton CLI in your home folder were
not removed; a package must not delete files there. To remove them, run this as yourself BEFORE
removing the package:

    protonbackup --cleanup

If the package is already gone, remove them by hand, as yourself:

    systemctl --user disable --now protonbackup-sync.timer
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/ProtonBackup ~/.config/ProtonBackup ~/.cache/ProtonBackup
    rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/protonbackup-sync.service
    rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/protonbackup-sync@.service
    rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/protonbackup-sync.timer
    rm -rf ~/.config/systemd/user/protonbackup-sync.timer.d
    rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/protonbackup-sync.timer
    rm -f ~/.local/share/systemd/timers/stamp-protonbackup-sync.timer
    systemctl --user daemon-reload

Nothing on Proton Drive is touched by any of this. If you are signed in, sign out first
(Settings, Account) so the Proton session leaves your keyring too.
